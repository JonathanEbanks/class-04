## Q&A

1. What is HTML and why do we use it?

    - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.

2. What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?

    - The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.

    - The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.

    - The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.

3. What is it called when you give an element extra information?

    - Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content.

4. What is a semantic element?

    - A Semantic element gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning).
